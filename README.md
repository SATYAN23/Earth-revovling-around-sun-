my good wishes to you all folks around

today, i am talking about a python code developed based on earth and moon relationship
taking earth as center and moon revolving around it 


while calculating speed of moon around earth

since distance directly proportional to runtime based on mass ratio of two planets

i.e,   velocity units are " dD / dt " means change in mass proportional to change in runtime

since earth mass is four times bigger than mass of moon so i taken 100:25 ratio under runtime for 
calculation of velocityof moon revolving around earth and also circumference of revolving circle 
takes as displacement 

overrall distance of moon around earth is "329.70units" as per observations 


# calculated value

Also muthual force exerting on earth and moon is 

f = (g * m1 * m2)/(r * 2)

g = 6.67* e-11 Nm2/kg2

v = dD/dt

D = 2 * PI * dr


# observed value

observed unidirectional force from moon to earth only is f=ma is 35.258 units

taking muthual directional force i.e.,2*f is 70.162 units

i say sometimes moon moves four times slower in order to maintain monsoon season
